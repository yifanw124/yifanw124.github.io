Part 2 - Q2

# Creating a linear regression model
model = smf.ols('PTS ~ AST', data=nba)
results = model.fit()

print(results.summary())
```

Comments on findings (brief): The OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression results show the relationship between 'PTS' (dependent variable) and 'AST' (independent variable).
The R-squared value is approximately 0.457, indicating that about 45.7% of the variance in total points ('PTS') can be explained by the total assists ('AST') in this model.
The coefficient for AST is approximately 2.3989. This suggests that, on average, for each additional assist a player has, their total points tend to increase by about 2.4 points, holding other factors constant (though in this simple model, 'AST' is the only predictor).
The p-value associated with the 'AST' coefficient is ~0, which is very low (< 5%). This indicates that the relationship between assists and points is statistically significant; we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between them.
To sum up - there's a statistically significant and positive relationship between the number of assists and the total points scored by NBA players in this dataset, with assists explaining a moderate portion of the variation in points.
